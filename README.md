In this class students will learn the fundamentals of statistical
inference. Students will receive a broad overview of the goals,
assumptions and modes of performing statistical inference. Students will
be able to perform inferential tasks in highly targeted settings and
will be able to use the skills developed as a roadmap for more complex
inferential challenges.
