Choose 4 columns and do the following for each of these columns:
1) Plot the distribution of data in that column using a histogram if the data is quantitative and a bar chart if the data is categorical. 
2) Add a title and axes labels to the plot.
3) Add the plot to your project page and write several sentences telling the reader what they should notice about the plot (ex. shape of distribution, outliers, skew, anything surprising, etc)
4) Add your R code (as a .R file) for this step to your GitHub account.
