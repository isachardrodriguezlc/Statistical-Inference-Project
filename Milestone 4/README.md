1. Based on the distribution plots from the previous step, you may see outliers that are so extreme they could dominate the analysis. You can choose to remove these outliers and use the remaining data for the rest of the steps. You may also wish to remove observations with missing data, or replace the missing data with a median (or other) value.
If you want to remove any outliers or observations (rows) with missing data:
Take a subset of your data to remove the desired observations (see babies data cleaning video for example).
Write a few sentences on your project page describing what data was removed and why (you may want to reference the plots from Milestone 3).
Redo any plots from Milestone 3 that changed. Leave the original plot and description on your project page, and add the redone plot with a few sentences describing any changes. 

If you want to replace missing values with a median (or other) value:
Replace the missing values with the median for that column or another value that makes sense (see babies data cleaning video for example).
Write a few sentences on your project page describing what missing data was replaced and why.
Redo any plots from Milestone 3 that changed. Leave the original plot and description on your project page, and add the redone plot with a few sentences describing any changes. 

If there was no missing data and either no outliers or you wish to keep them, then add a sentence to your project page saying so.
2. Add your R code for this milestone to your GitHub account.
