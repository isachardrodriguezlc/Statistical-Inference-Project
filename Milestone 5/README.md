1) For at least one pair of quantitative columns/variables:
- Plot a scatterplot of the data in the two columns/variables.
- Compute the correlation between the columns/variables.
- Add the scatterplot and correlation to your project page.
- Add a few sentences on your project page interpreting the scatterplot and correlation (ex. how closely are the two variables related? If there is a relationship, does it appear linear?)
2) Add your R code for this milestone to your GitHub account.
